# Stub Your Toe
This is a ~~completely serious~~, totally ~~not~~ a joke Minecraft mod that adds a 0.0001% chance (configurable) to stub your toe every time your character crosses the edge of a block while grounded. This chance is doubled (configurable) if your Y  level changes (with the exception of jumping) while you are walking (ex: stairs, slabs, etc.) The effect will not be triggered if you are sneaking. (Just about everything is configurable... I don't know why I keep putting "configurable" in parentheses...)

If you have the [ParCool! ~ Minecraft Parkour ~](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/parcool) mod, stubbing your toe will also trigger a roll. (This can be disabled via configuration.)

This mod was inspired by the [Starbound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/) mod [Stub Your Toe](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2705687952) which effectively does the same thing.

Like the Starbound mod, this mod adds a status effect with 3 different tiers.
The faster you were moving when you stubbed your toe, the higher the tier of the status effect that is applied:
- The first tier reduces your movement speed by 75% for 65 seconds (configurable) and can be triggered by moving at walk speed.
- The second tier does the same thing as the first tier, but it also disables sprinting for 20 seconds (configurable) and can be triggered by moving at sprint speed. This status effect decays into the first tier after after the initial 20 seconds of disabled sprint.
- The third tier disables movement for 5 seconds (configurable) and can be triggered by moving faster than sprint speed. This tier decays into the second tier after the initial 5 seconds.
